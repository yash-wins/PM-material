## **What is a Product Manager?**

The modern product manager is someone who solves business problems by focusing his or her efforts on a user while working with a development team to create impactful solutions.

When it comes to product managers, two things are the key:

- **Opportunity Identification** - have we found a problem that many users want us to solve and will pay for it?
- **Solution Discovery** - have we understood the problem well enough to build a solution to that problem?

## Intersection of Business, Users, and Technology

Product managers are often said to be at the intersection of the users, business, and technology. There is a reason for this - in fact, there are three reasons:

- **User Experience (UX)** - Do we understand users and their problems well enough to create an unrivaled user experience?
- **Business** - Do you understand your business, its mission, and vision well enough to execute a disruptive change in the market?
- **Technology** - Do you have the aptitude and influence to guide a development team to build the solution that users and the business need?

## Product manager vs. Other Roles

Product management is an evolving field and highly competitive. The Product Manager role has responsibilities that appear to overlap other job titles: you may ask if you do the same things as a Project Manager, a Program Manager, or Product Owner. Below, we break down the common roles to illustrate how they compare to the Product Manager.

## What is a Product Manager or Product Owner?

A product is an artifact that is manufactured or refined for sale. Often this is an object, a physical item or commodity; in Digital Product Management, the product is most often a digital system (e.g., mobile app) or a physical product that incorporates a digital system (e.g., point-of-sale terminal).

Two job titles used commonly in this field are Product Manager and Product Owner
.

The Product Owner role was described first by the authors of Scrum and Extreme Programming. The two terms are used interchangeably by many: though it can be said the term Product Manager is used more broadly in the industry; and the term Product Owner is used by companies who deliberately advertise that they practice Scrum.

Both terms imply a product (not project) orientation in the company.

### Other Related Roles

#### Product Analyst

The Product Analyst role is considered a stepping stone to the Product Manager role. Heavy on research, interviews, and data analytics, they often support Product Managers by providing them the data needed to make decisions.

#### Product Designer

As you might have guessed from the title, Product Designers focus primarily on design. Also called UX Designers (User Experience), UI Designers (User Interface), XD (Experience Designers), Information architects (IA), and many others, they are responsible for understanding the user experience and designing the look and flow. Product designers work on or with the product team.

## What is a Project Manager?

A project is a temporary effort to create a unique product, service or result. All projects have a beginning and an end. A Project Manager is one who manages personnel, a budget, and a schedule of activities/tasks.

Note the differences:

- A project is a temporary endeavor like the construction of a house or bridge. A product is not temporary. For example, the Android operating system was released in 2008 and development of the product continues to this day.
- A project has a known end state: the house. A product has no known end state: new features are added to Android continually.

## What is a Program Manager?

There is no industry-wide definition of Program Manager. Usually, the term is applied to a person who supervises the effort of multiple groups in a company who must coordinate the delivery of service and/or product.

## Product Manager vs. Other Roles

Since product management is still an up-and-coming field, many are unfamiliar with what product managers do. People may ask you if you do the same things as a project manager, a program manager, or a product owner. The short answer is no. Although they might overlap in some areas, all of these roles are distinctly different from the one played by the Product Manager. Below, we break a few of the more common roles down and show how they interact with product management.

**Product Owner**

Product Owners are focused on the development side. Where product managers determine what features should be prioritized based on user need, product owners determine how a particular feature should be built. Sometimes, a product manager will also take on the product owner role.

**Project Manager**

Project managers are responsible for keeping a project on schedule, within scope, and within budget. This differs from a product manager, who is responsible for a product; unlike a project, which has a definite start and end date, a product is flexible and continuous as well as being user-focused.

**Program Manager**

Program managers generally oversee a number of projects and project managers. Like the Product Manager, who provides strategic guidance for Product Owners (who oversee a feature), Program Managers provide that guidance for Project Managers (who oversee a project).

This chart shows the key differences between 4 commonly confused roles

**Product Analyst**

Product analysts are considered a stepping stone to the product manager role. Heavy on research, interviews, and data analytics, they often support product managers by providing them with the data they need to make decisions.

**Product Designer**

As you might have guessed from the title, product designers focus primarily on design.
